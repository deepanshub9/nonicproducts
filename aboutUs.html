                <span class="container1">"</span> Nonic is a startup, found in India with an aim of creating a sustainable environment. It all started when the founder, Shivam Mishra, came back to India from Singapore after pursuing his studies. He realised
                how India was lacking in terms of sustainable products and recycling infrastructure compared to other countries and there is much scope. Shivam has a creative mind and believes that big changes always start with small goals. He was determined
                to eradicate the problem of single-use plastics. He came back to India and started his own firm with a motive to solve the problem of ever-growing plastic pollution. The idea of launching Nonic toothbrush came into his mind as it a basic
                thing from which we could start eliminating the use of plastic products.

                The company is committed to developing products which would be direct ecofreindly alternative to single-plastic products. The nonic toothbrush are biodegradable, long lasting and also improves oral hygiene. We wish to bring a strong impact through this
                and eliminate single use plastics completely. The bamboo toothbrush is just one step towards making this planet clean, healthy and sustainable. We aim of launching other eco-friendly products too like biodegradable pens, bamboo bottles,
                baskets and other substitute products of plastic. The bamboo used to make these toothbrushes are harvested with the help of local farmers from the various places of country. Once the bamboo are cultivated, the land is cleared and the new
                are harvested on the same land. Thus, keeping a balance on both the socio and ecological aspects. This move also helps in giving employment opportunities to the local people. With the clear vision of making this planet a powerful space
                for the next generation, we also set campaigns and clean up drives. The company is also looking to collaborate with NGOs that work towards sustainability and environmental. We also spread awareness among rural people about saving the environment
                and small steps they could take to reduce single use plastics, like carrying their own recyclable bags while going to the market.

                The nonic toothbrush is a brand which works towards the environment and for the environment. Our brand vision is to eradicate single use plastic as much as possible, making environment a sustainable space for the coming generation.
                <br>
                <br> We are starting with small steps like bamboo toothbrush, in future we would continue to make more products that are safer for the environment.

                The nonic toothbrush are 100% biodegradable with bamboo handle and nylon fibres. They are just as effective as the plastic toothbrush, but with an added advantage that plastic harms the environment, whereas the nonic toothbrush is totally eco-friendly,
                even its packaging.
                <br>
                <br> What makes it even more charming is the flower incarnated on the toothbrush, making it more unique. The toothbrush also helps you in eliminating unnecessary waste.
